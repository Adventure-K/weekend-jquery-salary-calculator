## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This page takes input from the user to populate a table showing a list of employees including their names, employee IDs, titles, and annual salary. 
Each entry includes a button for deleting that entry. 
It also uses the inputs to calculate a monthly payroll expense of all tabled employees. The monthly expense figure receives a red highlight any time it exceeds $20,000.

To submit an entry, all fields must be completed. If they are not, a warning is given and the function is interrupted. The fields are cleared after successful submission.

The entry deletion function tracks the relevant entry by the employee ID, which is presumed to be unique.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
